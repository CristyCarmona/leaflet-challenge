## Title:
Tectonic plates and Earthquakes 

## Description:
In this project you will find an interesting visualization about earthquakes that have happened in the last 7 days. Additionally, you'll able to see the tectonic plates 
distribution all over the world. 
                                                                                                                                                                  
The earthquakes' data comes from  a massive anount of information collected from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for 
providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. This data is collected from 
all over the world each day and it's available through the next url https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson".
                                                                                                                                                                   
The tectonic plates information comes from the next data set https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master/GeoJSON available in GitHub.
